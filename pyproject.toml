description = "These nodes provide a wrapper for calling Draw Things image generations from ComfyUI. The Draw Things app has been optimized for Apple hardware and runs roughly x3 faster than ComfyUI generations. But ComfyUI is a flexible and powerful tool, and has some features - like queuing and face swapping - that haven't been implemented in Draw Things."
